                <p>Because each restaurant meal is individually prepared for you when you place an order, orders cannot be cancelled once they are placed.</p>

                <p>Refunds, if offered at the sole discretion of restaurant management, can only be issued by restaurant management.  EasyWay Ordering does not have the authority to grant refunds.</p>
