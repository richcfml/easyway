= 1.6.0 =
This update brings the plugin up to date to use Twitters OAuth settings and requires a consumer key, token and a few other API keys. This is a complete overhaul and pretty much a brand new plugin. Since Twitter has changed their API rules and you can not longer access their API without the proper access the plugin had to be rebuilt. If your tweets have stopped showing then you need this update. You will need to create an account on the application section of Tweeter. You can do so by logging in <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/4665311/oauth">HERE</a> using your twitter account login information. The plugin still works with your themes css and will be styled to match all of your other plugins and/or widgets.
= 1.6.0 =
Had some people that installed the plugin states they were getting some errors so we went through the plugin to issue there are not problems. We have been unable to replicate any problems so any help from anyone receiving any would help out. Please email all your issues to support@teamwebusa.com and we will reply back as soon as possible.
